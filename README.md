## Installing

DRAMSpec requires some libraries from [boost](http://www.boost.org/). If you do not have it or the version you have is older than the 1.58, please follow the first four (4) steps from their [getting started](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_63_0/more/getting_started/unix-variants.html) section. After updating your boost version, make sure to link it properly in the [project file](DRAMSpec.pro#L43).

DRAMSpec is built as a Qt Creator project, therefore requiring the `qmake` tool. If you do not have Qt installed, you can find it [here](http://www.qt.io/download). The current version of DRAMSpec is properly built by QMake version 3.0 and Qt version 5.2.1 or newer. You can check your QMake and Qt version using the following command:

``` bash
    qmake --version
```

### Cloning from github (recursive to get submodules!)
``` bash
    git clone --recursive <URL>
```

### Building DRAMSpec

1. To be sure DRAMSpec repository was properly cloned, build and run the program in test mode either by using the script below or compiling and running the debug version of the program manually. If chosen to do manually, make sure you run the executable directly from within the directory `build/debug`!

``` bash
    ./runTests.sh
```

2. After getting the "No errors detected" message, you are ready to build DRAMSpec itself. To do that, simply run the [buildDRAMSpec.sh](buildDRAMSpec.sh) script:

``` bash
    ./buildDRAMSpec.sh
```

The executable is now available under `build/release/` by the name `dramspec`.

### Running DRAMSpec

The program expect as parameters (at least) one technology and one achitecture description files. The flags `-t` and `-p` precede the technology and architecture description files, respectively.

The optional `-term` flag will include the IO termination currents for read and write operations of the DRAM.

For more detailed information on timings, it is possible to print out all internal timing variables using the flag `-internaltimings`.

``` bash
    ./build/release/dramspec -t <path/to/technologyfilename> -p <path/to/parameterfilename> [-term] [-internaltimings]
```

#### Examples:

``` bash
    ./build/release/dramspec -t technology_input/techddr3_5x.json -p architecture_input/parddr3.json
```

It is also possible to run multiple input files at once:

``` bash
    ./build/release/dramspec -t <t1.json> <t2.json> -p <p1.json> <p2.json> [-term] [-internaltimings]
```
Note: the number of technology and architecture description files must be equal.
